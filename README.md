# Golden Kappa Checker
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pabli24/GoldenKappaChecker/main/kappa_notification.png)

Checks if you have a Golden Kappa, by sending Kappa in twitch whispers from one account to another, that you set in config.js <br>
Then you get a windows notification if you got golden kappa or not.

If you looked through my code and still want to use it 
- Install https://nodejs.org
- Put your logins and passwords in config.js
- Run run.bat file or in console go to this folder and type "node bot.js"
- You can put a shortcut of run.bat to autostart folder in windows
